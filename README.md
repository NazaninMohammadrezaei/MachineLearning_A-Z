# Machine learning using Python 
This repository is about practicing data preprocessing, and also Machine learning algorithms including different types of regression , classification , dimensionality reduction algorithms, clustering techniques, building a recommendation systems, etc.

The codes in this Git repository are what I have learned from the udemy course `Machine learning A-Z: Hands-on Python and R in Data Science`. 

Make sure to visit the website and enroll if you want one complete course about ML algorithms. It is simply wonderful.

Here is the link to this course: [Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)
